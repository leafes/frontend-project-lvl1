### A set of simple mathematical games in the CLI.

What I learned during this project:
Initializing and configuring an npm project
Installing and configuring npm packages
Structuring the project
Git :)
ESlinter: setting up and using in a project

## Installation guide:
install dependancies 

	make install
global link so u can start games without full path to files, through comands like brain-calc

	npm link
start the game 

	brain-calc
